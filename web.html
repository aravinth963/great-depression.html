       <blockquote>It cannot be emphasized too strongly that [productivity, output, and
      employment] trends we are describing are long-time trends and were
      thoroughly evident before 1929. these trends are in nowise the result the
      depression, nor are they the result of the world war . On the contray, the
      present depression is collapse from these long-term trends.

      electrification, mass production, and motorized farm achinay, and because
      of the rapid gowth in productivity there was a lot of excess production
      capacity and the work week wasn being reduced.
